**DIDentity** is a comprehensive decentralized identity platform based on microservices architecture, implementing DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers), Verifiable Credentials, and secure authentication. Built with security and scalability in mind, DIDentity provides a complete solution for managing digital identity in a decentralized environment.

## Purpose & Motivation

Modern digital identity requires secure, user-controlled, and interoperable solutions. DIDentity aims to:

- Provide a complete implementation of W3C DID standards
- Enable secure issuance and verification of Verifiable Credentials
- Implement robust authentication mechanisms
- Offer a scalable, microservices-based architecture
- Create an extensible platform for decentralized identity use cases

## Quick Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Setup and Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ParleSec/DIDentity.git
   cd DIDentity
   ```

2. Start the services using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   sudo docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. The services will be available at:
   - **Monitoring Dashboard**: http://localhost:8080 (Unified monitoring interface)
   - **Auth Service**: http://localhost:8004
   - **DID Service**: http://localhost:8001
   - **Credential Service**: http://localhost:8002
   - **Verification Service**: http://localhost:8003
   - **RabbitMQ Management**: http://localhost:15672 (credentials managed by Vault)
   - **Vault UI**: http://localhost:8200 (token: root)
   - **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (credentials managed by Vault)
   - **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
   - **Jaeger UI**: http://localhost:16686

## Architecture

DIDentity consists of several microservices:
- **Auth Service**: User authentication and authorization (port 8004)

## Vault Secret Management

### Secret Organization

Secrets are organized in Vault using the following structure:

```
kv/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database/config          # Database connection details
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rabbitmq/config          # RabbitMQ credentials and settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/jwt                 # JWT configuration and keys
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ grafana/config           # Grafana admin credentials
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security/encryption      # Master encryption keys
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ monitoring/config        # Monitoring endpoints and settings
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ services/api_keys        # Service-specific API keys
```

### Accessing Vault

- **Vault UI**: http://localhost:8200 (token: root)
- **CLI Access**: Use `vault` commands with `VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200` and `VAULT_TOKEN=root`

### Vault Commands

```bash
# Check Vault status
vault status

# List all secrets
vault kv list kv/

# Get database configuration
vault kv get kv/database/config

# Get specific secret value
vault kv get -field=password kv/database/config
```
