**DIDentity** is a comprehensive decentralized identity platform based on microservices architecture, implementing DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers), Verifiable Credentials, and secure authentication. Built with security and scalability in mind, DIDentity provides a complete solution for managing digital identity in a decentralized environment.

## Purpose & Motivation

Modern digital identity requires secure, user-controlled, and interoperable solutions. DIDentity aims to:

- Provide a complete implementation of W3C DID standards
- Enable secure issuance and verification of Verifiable Credentials
- Implement robust authentication mechanisms
- Offer a scalable, microservices-based architecture
- Create an extensible platform for decentralized identity use cases

## Quick Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Setup and Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ParleSec/DIDentity.git
   cd DIDentity
   ```

2. Start the services using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   sudo docker-compose up -d
   ```
3. The services will be available at:
   - **Monitoring Dashboard**: http://localhost:8080 (Unified monitoring interface)
   - **Auth Service**: http://localhost:8004
   - **DID Service**: http://localhost:8001
   - **Credential Service**: http://localhost:8002
   - **Verification Service**: http://localhost:8003
   - **RabbitMQ Management**: http://localhost:15672 (guest/guest)
   - **Vault UI**: http://localhost:8200 (token: root)
   - **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
   - **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
   - **Jaeger UI**: http://localhost:16686

## Architecture
DIDentity consists of several microservices:
- **Auth Service**: User authentication and authorization (port 8004)
- **DID Service**: Decentralized Identifier (DID) management (port 8001)
- **Credential Service**: Verifiable Credentials issuance and management (port 8002)
- **Verification Service**: Verification of Credentials (port 8003)

The platform uses:
- **PostgreSQL**: For persistent data storage
- **HashiCorp Vault**: For secrets management
- **RabbitMQ**: For event-driven communication between services
- **Jaeger**: For distributed tracing
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: For monitoring and alerting

```

### Create a DID

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/dids \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method":"ethr","identifier":"0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"}'
```

### Resolve a DID

```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/dids/did:ethr:0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
```

### Issue a Credential

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/credentials \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "issuerDid": "did:ethr:0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678",
    "subjectDid": "did:ethr:0x9876543210abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EducationCredential"],
    "claims": {
      "degree": "Bachelor of Science",
      "institution": "Example University"
    }
  }'
```

### Verify a Credential

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "credential": {
      // Credential JSON
    }
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting

**üí° Pro Tip**: Use the **Monitoring Dashboard** at http://localhost:8000 for comprehensive system monitoring and troubleshooting. The dashboard provides real-time health checks, connection testing, and detailed error diagnostics for all services.

Common issues:

1. **Service Connection Issues**: 
   - Check the Monitoring Dashboard for real-time service status
   - Ensure all containers are running with `docker-compose ps`
   - Use the dashboard's "Test Connection" buttons for detailed diagnostics

2. **Database Errors**: Check PostgreSQL logs with `docker-compose logs postgres`

3. **Authentication Failures**: Verify Vault is properly initialized and unsealed

4. **Missing Events**: Check RabbitMQ management console for queue status

5. **Monitoring Tool Issues**: 
   - Use the Monitoring Dashboard's embedded interfaces
   - Check individual tool health via the dashboard's connection tests
   - Review troubleshooting suggestions provided by the dashboard
